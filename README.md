+ Project summary: In this project, we explored matrix factorization methods for recommender system. The goal is to match consumers with most appropriate products. Matrix factorization methods characterize both items and users by vectors of factors inferred from item rating patterns. High correspondence between item and user factors leads to a recommendation. Matrix factorization generally has 3 parts:
- factorization algorithm
- regularization
- postpocessing
